                This started our family on a food journey that has brought us to this dressing. Yeshi is the product of a lot of research, trial and error. We have found that you can have good food and still be healthy. Barbara has a professional cooking degree from SAIT in Alberta. For me this was an easy transition as she is a great cook and is always very experimental in her cooking.  Not that long ago we started a Ketogenic Diet (No Carbohydrates) and lucky for us Yeshi is also Keto Friendly. This is a very good dressing for Vegetarians and for Meatatarians alike. It is so versatile, as it is also Dairy Free, Nut Free and Egg Free.
